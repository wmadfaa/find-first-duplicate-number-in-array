#First Duplicate in Array

## Problem

Given an array `a` that contains only numbers in the range
from `1` to `a.length`, find the first duplicate _number_ for
which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if
there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the _number_ for
which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second
occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements,
return `-1`.
